# 🍔 React Burger — Burger Store App Built with React

**React Burger** is a learning-oriented single-page application developed using React. This project simulates an online burger shop, allowing users to browse the catalog, choose patty sizes, apply filters, sort items, and manage a shopping cart.

> 🛠 Originally started as a pizza store project, this app was later adapted to showcase **burgers**. Some variable names or constants may still refer to "pizza" — they now correspond to **burgers**.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This app was built as part of my journey in mastering modern frontend development with React. It focuses on hands-on experience with component architecture, state management, API integration, and UI responsiveness.

## 📝 Notes

- You may still encounter some naming like `pizza`, especially in variable or file names — that’s due to the initial pizza theme. Functionality and content are fully adapted for **burgers**.
- This is a frontend-focused educational project and does not include a production backend.
