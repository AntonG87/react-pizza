🍔 React Burger — Burger Store App Built with React
React Burger is a learning-oriented single-page application developed using React. This project simulates an online burger shop, allowing users to browse the catalog, choose patty sizes, apply filters, sort items, and manage a shopping cart.

🛠 Originally started as a pizza store project, this app was later adapted to showcase burgers. Some variable names or constants may still refer to "pizza" — they now correspond to burgers.

🚀 Project Purpose
This app was built as part of my journey in mastering modern frontend development with React. It focuses on hands-on experience with component architecture, state management, API integration, and UI responsiveness.

🔧 Tech Stack
⚛️ React (with Hooks & Functional Components)

🛠 Redux Toolkit for state management

🔁 React Router for client-side routing

🌐 Axios for API requests

🎨 SCSS / CSS Modules for styling

🛒 Cart logic with dynamic count and total price

🔍 Search, filter, and sorting functionality

📱 (Partial) mobile responsiveness

✅ Features
Product listing with burger images, weight options, and descriptions

Filtering by category (Meat, Vegetarian, Grill, Spicy, etc.)

Sorting by popularity and price

Full-text search by burger name

Add to cart with visual counter and total cost

Clean and simple UI

📝 Notes
You may still encounter some naming like pizza, especially in variable or file names — that’s due to the initial pizza theme. Functionality and content are fully adapted for burgers.

This is a frontend-focused educational project and does not include a production backend.
